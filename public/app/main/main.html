MGA analysis helps participating countries strengthen governance of the sector, attract mining investment, and improve the use of resource revenues for sustainable national development. It also provides succinct, relevant information to investors and civil society groups to inform their decisions on investment, governance, potential growth and other aspects of the mining sector.</p></div></div>
